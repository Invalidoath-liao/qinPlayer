00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.660
Good morning, Mr. Bryce.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660

I trust the pickup ran smoothly.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.120

Handoff was clean.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.580

No stops till the exit point.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.250

Clear roads all the way, chief...

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.080

Just as you predicted.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.700

Thank you for agreeing to an earlier departure time,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.910

Mr. Kurosawa.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.250

I'm honored that you and your wives

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.540

Have entrusted a triple A protection service today.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.450

Moving red to green option

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.450

Coming in on your vector.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.660

Get the engine started.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.080

I want immediate takeoff.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.870

Air space has already been cleared.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.410

Roger that.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.410

All channels moving to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.790

Restricted air space.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.410

Shall we?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.080

Mr. Kurosawa...

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.790

Safe travels.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.620

Thank you very much, michael.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.120

Another triple A delivery, sir.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.500

Stay with him till he's airborne.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.450

Yes, sir.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.790

Canvas is clear?

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.080

Nothing for miles, chief.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.120

Almost boring.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.200

And what's our motto?

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.580

Boring is always best.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.700

Move! Move!
